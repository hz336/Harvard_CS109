## Extract Alpha from Glassdoor

### Motivation:

Machine learning has taken the world by storm in recent years, and the asset management industry has been an early adopter, leveraging incredible amounts of data to increase the efficiency and performance of both their funds as well as other intra-office functions. On the quantitative investing side, companies specifically use machine learning to look for signals that can give them even the smallest edge over their competitors and search for patterns that they can automate reactions to or even predict outright. 

Glassdoor, a website founded in 2007, consists of millions of current and former employee reviews of companies and management teams. Each reviewer gives their own ratings of work-life balance, culture & values, career opportunities, comp & benefits, and senior management. Instead of relying on Fortune’s annual “Happiest Places to Work” article, an algorithm can continuously scan posts on Glassdoor to see if employee satisfaction at a company is trending positively or negatively. 


### Goal:

Predict future stock returns based on reviews, ratings and other features on Glassdoor.
